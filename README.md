# cln-tools
Usually when you try to clone a repo with a token you must put the token everytime and that's annoying, and here comes my humble script, to make it easier.

You can install it with one line command:

`git clone https://github.com/Hayoun01/cln-tools.git; cd cln-tools; chmod +x ins; ./ins`

Then: 
`cln repo_url`

It will ask you for the token for the first time only then you can clone any repo without token.

If there are any issues let me know.
